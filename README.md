# Convert PyTorch model to Tensorflow

 I have used ONNX[Open Neural Network Exchange] to convert the PyTorch model to Tensorflow.
 
 ONNX is an open format built to represent machine learning models. ONNX defines a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning and deep learning models -   and a common file format to enable AI developers to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.
